Everything sround us is a transactions
these transactions are stored in ledger

Ledgers can be offline or online tables in a database.
Need of ledgers-
-> Authencity of transaction
-> Tracking of transaction
-> Legal purposes like tax authorities
-> Arbitration in case of dispute

The ledgers are mainly maintained by some central authority
Pitfalls of maintaining ledgers by a central authority-
-> single point of failure
-> chance of security breach
-> Loss due to natural disaster
-> Possibility of Manipulation
-> arbitary levy of service charges
-> Bureaucratic/Permission based access

So, blockchain is basically used to overcome these pitfalls-
-> peer to peer transactions
-> high security
-> no central authority
and many more

Blockchain was initally developed as framework for maintaining bitcoin transactions
it is a distributed framework

A block contains basically data, hash and prv hash.
A chain connects multiple blocks
The first block is called genesis block

The hash is a one way algorithm that means it cannot be decoded and it is done using a hash function
it constantly checks the hash of the current block and the prv hash in the next block to check for manipulation of the encrypted data.

It uses census(people/nodes vote for the happening of transaction)
in bitcoin it uses proof of stake and only one person gets the incentive.(51% nodes vote requird and a mathematical problem is given for the acquirment of the incentive)

CHARACTERTICS :-
Blockchain is immutable
It is provenance(history of all transactions)
It provides single source of truth(It has the same copy of the ledger)
It has standardization(eveyone uses the same standard of blockchain)
Highest security
It has a concept of smart contract(It is both automated and enforceable/verifies the person's detail)

BLOCKCHAIN TYPES:-
-> Public
-> Private/enterprise

on private blockchain the broadcast is limited to the parties that are involved
and some people are nominated for the voting

Applications:-
-> agriculture fields(track where the crop actually came from)
-> walmart uses
-> health fields

What actually blackchain can do in real life:-
-> Emergence of token economy
-> Elimination of middle man
-> Trust and Transparency
-> Democratization
